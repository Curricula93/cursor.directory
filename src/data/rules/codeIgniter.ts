  Core Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate PHP/CodeIgniter examples.  
  - Prioritize SOLID principles for object-oriented programming and clean architecture.
  - Follow PHP and CodeIgniter best practices, ensuring consistency and readability.
  - Design for scalability and maintainability, ensuring the system can grow with ease.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication to promote code reuse.
  - Use consistent and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes to improve readability.

  Dependencies
  - Composer for dependency management
  - PHP 7.4+
  - CodeIgniter 4.x+

  PHP and CodeIgniter Standards
  - Leverage PHP 7.4+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, arrow functions).
  - Adhere to PSR-12 coding standards for consistent code style.
  - Always use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1);
  - Utilize CodeIgniter's built-in features and helpers to maximize efficiency.
  - Follow CodeIgniter's directory structure and file naming conventions.
  - Implement robust error handling and logging:
    > Use CodeIgniter's exception handling and logging features.
    > Create custom exceptions when necessary.
    > Employ try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
  - Use CodeIgniter's validation features for form and request data.
  - Implement filters for request filtering and modification.
  - Utilize CodeIgniter's Model class for database interactions.

  CodeIgniter Best Practices
  - Use Model class and Query Builder over raw SQL queries when possible
  - Implement Repository and Service patterns for better code organization and reusability
  - Utilize CodeIgniter's built-in authentication library or implement custom authentication
  - Leverage CodeIgniter's caching mechanisms for improved performance

  Code Architecture
    * Naming Conventions:
      - Use consistent naming conventions for folders, classes, and files.
      - Follow CodeIgniter's conventions: singular for models, plural for controllers (e.g., User.php, Users.php).
      - Use PascalCase for class names, camelCase for method names, and snake_case for database columns.
    * Controller Design:
      - Keep controllers focused on handling HTTP requests and delegating to appropriate services.
      - Avoid injecting dependencies directly into controllers. Instead, use CodeIgniter's dependency injection container.
    * Model Design:
      - Extend CodeIgniter's Model class for database operations.
      - Use model callbacks (beforeInsert, afterFind, etc.) for data manipulation.
    * Services:
      - Create a Services folder within the app directory.
      - Organize services into model-specific services and other required services.
      - Use services for complex business logic, keeping controllers thin.
    * Routing:
      - Maintain consistent and organized routes in app/Config/Routes.php.
      - Group related routes together using RouteCollection::group().
    * Type Declarations:
      - Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
      - Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.
      - Leverage PHP 7.4+ features like typed properties when necessary.
    * Data Type Consistency:
      - Be consistent and explicit with data type declarations throughout the codebase.
      - Use type hints for properties, method parameters, and return types.
      - Leverage PHP's strict typing to catch type-related errors early.
    * Error Handling:
      - Use CodeIgniter's exception handling and logging features to handle exceptions.
      - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
      - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
      - Handle exceptions gracefully and return appropriate responses.
